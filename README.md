# Forge

A powerful symlink management tool designed as a modern alternative to GNU Stow.

## Overview

Forge provides comprehensive symlink management with clear, intuitive commands.

## Global Flags

- **-v, --verbose**: Enable verbose output for debugging and troubleshooting. When set, Forge will print additional details about operations, errors, and internal state to help diagnose issues.
- **-I, --interactive**: Use interactive mode (TUI, under development).

- **Stage**: Temporarily track files for symlinking
- **Link**: Create permanent symlinks for tracked files
- **Unlink**: Remove symlinks but keep files in the forge folder
- **Remove**: Delete files from the forge folder but keep originals
- **Delete**: Completely remove files from the system

## Features

- **Profile System**: Manage multiple configurations for the same target location
- **Multi-Directory Support**: Organize different types of symlinked content (dotfiles, scripts, etc.)
- **Pack-and-Go System**: Create portable configuration bundles for easy deployment and backup
- **Recursive Directory Packing**: Pack entire directory trees with depth control and dry-run preview
- **BLAKE3 Integrity Verification**: Cryptographic hash verification for all packed files
- **Interactive Mode**: Visual interface for managing symlink operations
- **SQLite Backend**: Reliable state tracking with transactional safety
- **Modular Design**: Core functionality with optional feature modules

7. **Font Management**: Organize and switch between font collections

## Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io (binary name will be 'forge')
cargo install forge-rs
```

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Initialize current directory as a forge managed folder (uses directory name if no name provided)
forge init [--name dotfiles]

# Stage a file for symlinking (creates a temporary link)
forge stage nvim/init.lua

# Stage an entire directory with all its contents recursively 
forge stage --recursive ~/.config/nvim

# Stage a directory with contents up to a specific depth
forge stage --depth=2 ~/.config/i3

# Create permanent symlinks for all staged files
forge link

# Remove symlinks but keep files in the forge folder
forge unlink init.lua

# Remove files from forge folder but keep originals
forge remove init.lua

# Completely delete files from the system
forge delete init.lua

# List all tracked files
forge list

# List all available profiles
forge list --profiles

# Switch to a different profile
forge switch coding
```

## Pack-and-Go System

Forge includes a powerful pack-and-go system for creating portable configuration bundles that can be easily deployed on new systems or used for backup and recovery.

### Basic Pack-and-Go Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize a new pack
forge start packing my_dotfiles

# 2. Add individual files
forge pack ~/.vimrc ~/.bashrc ~/.gitconfig

# 3. Add entire directories recursively
forge pack --recursive ~/.config/nvim/ ~/.ssh/

# 4. Add directories with limited depth
forge pack --depth 2 ~/.config/i3/

# 5. Preview what would be packed (without actually packing)
forge pack --recursive --dry-run ~/.local/bin/

# 6. Seal the pack into a portable archive
forge seal

# The result is a timestamped ZIP file: my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip
```

### Advanced Directory Packing

The pack system supports sophisticated directory handling:

```bash
# Pack entire directory trees while preserving structure
forge pack --recursive ~/.dotfiles/

# Limit recursion depth to avoid packing too much
forge pack --depth 3 ~/.config/

# Preview complex packing operations before execution
forge pack --recursive --dry-run ~/.home-configs/ ~/.work-configs/

# Combine different approaches in one pack
forge start packing mixed_environment
forge pack ~/.vimrc ~/.bashrc                    # Individual files
forge pack --recursive ~/.config/nvim/           # Full directory
forge pack --depth 1 ~/.local/bin/               # Limited depth
forge pack --dry-run --recursive ~/.scripts/     # Preview first
forge pack --recursive ~/.scripts/               # Then actually pack
forge seal
```

### Deployment and Installation

```bash
# Preview pack contents and installation plan
forge explain my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip

# Preview installation to specific directory
forge explain my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --install --target /home/newuser

# Install to current directory (safe default)
forge install my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip

# Install to specific target directory
forge install my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --target /home/user/configs

# Install with automatic home directory mapping
forge install my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --map-home

# Preview installation without making changes
forge install my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --dry-run --target /tmp/test

# Force installation (overwrite existing files)
forge install my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --force

# Skip existing files during installation
forge install my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --skip-existing
```

### Backup and Recovery

```bash
# Restore pack to original absolute paths (for backup recovery)
forge restore my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip

# Test restore to current directory (safe testing)
forge restore my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --test

# Preview restore operation
forge restore my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --dry-run

# Force restore (overwrite existing files)
forge restore my_dotfiles-2025-06-23.zip --force
```

### Pack Management

```bash
# Update files in an existing pack
forge repack --scope my_dotfiles ~/.vimrc ~/.bashrc

# Update all files in a pack with current versions
forge repack --scope my_dotfiles

# Remove files from a pack
forge unpack --scope my_dotfiles ~/.old_config

# Remove and reseal
forge unpack ~/.deprecated_files
forge seal
```

### Key Features

- **Directory Structure Preservation**: Recursive packing maintains full directory trees
- **Depth Control**: Limit recursion depth to avoid packing unwanted nested content
- **Dry-Run Mode**: Preview packing operations before execution
- **BLAKE3 Integrity**: All files are cryptographically hashed for integrity verification
- **Flexible Deployment**: Install to any directory with automatic path mapping
- **Safe Testing**: Preview and test operations before making permanent changes
- **Conflict Detection**: Identify file conflicts before installation

## Profiles

Profiles allow you to maintain multiple configurations that target the same location:

```bash
# Create a new profile in a specific location
forge new --profile coding ~/dotfiles/coding

# List available profiles
forge list --profiles

# Switch to a profile
forge switch coding

# Initialize current directory as a new profile
forge init --name coding
```

## Interactive Mode

Interactive TUI mode is under development. Launch with:

```bash
forge -I
```

*Note: Interactive mode is currently a placeholder and will display a message indicating it's not fully implemented.*

## Requirements

- Rust (Minimum supported version: 1.65.0)
- GNU/Linux or other free operating system
- Standard system libraries

## Version Policy and crates.io Releases

This project follows semantic versioning (SemVer) for crates.io releases:

- **Patch updates (0.1.0 → 0.1.1)**: Bug fixes and minor documentation updates
- **Minor updates (0.1.0 → 0.2.0)**: New features that don't break compatibility
- **Major updates (0.x.x → 1.0.0)**: Breaking changes or API redesigns

### Publication Guidelines

- Documentation-only changes don't require a version bump
- The `docs` branch is used for documentation development
- Feature development occurs on dedicated `feature/*` branches
- Version bumps occur on the `main` branch before publication to crates.io

## Troubleshooting and Error Handling

Forge is designed to handle errors gracefully and report issues to the user via standard error (stderr) and exit codes.

### How Errors Are Reported

- **Exit Codes**: Forge exits with status `0` on success, and a nonzero code (`>0`) if an error occurs.
- **Error Messages**: Most errors are printed to stderr with a message describing the failure. Some errors may include additional context, but not all error messages are highly detailed.

### Common Error Scenarios

- **"Failed to create directory"**: The target directory could not be created, possibly due to permissions or a race condition if multiple processes are running Forge simultaneously.
- **"No managed folders found. Please run 'forge init' first."**: You must initialize a managed folder before using most commands.
- **"Hash mismatch"**: Indicates a file integrity check failed during pack or restore operations.
- **"File does not exist"**: The specified file or directory was not found at the given path.

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have read/write permissions for all involved files and directories.
2. **Check Paths**: Verify that all file and directory paths are correct and exist.
3. **Run with Verbose Output**: Use `-v` or `--verbose` flags for more detailed output. This will print additional information about what Forge is doing, including file operations, error context, and internal state.
4. **Check for Concurrent Operations**: Avoid running multiple Forge commands in parallel, as this may cause race conditions in directory creation.
5. **Database Issues**: If you encounter inconsistent state or missing data, it may be due to a failed operation. Currently, database operations are not transactional; rerun the command or re-initialize if needed.

### Known Limitations

- **Race Conditions**: Directory creation is not atomic; rare failures may occur if multiple Forge processes run concurrently.
- **Database Transactions**: Some operations do not use database transactions, which could lead to inconsistent state if interrupted.
- **Error Context**: Some error messages may lack detailed context. If you encounter a cryptic error, please report it.
